# Alzheimer's Disease Classification using Deep Learning

This project investigates the predictive capabilities of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **transfer learning models** (Inception V3, ResNet-18, ResNet-50) for the progression and early detection of **Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)**.  

Alzheimer’s disease prediction plays a critical role in **early intervention and patient care**, and this work contributes to developing reliable, efficient deep learning approaches for diagnosis.
